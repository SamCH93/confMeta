#' @param check_inputs Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. Indicates whether or not to check the input arguments.
#' The idea of this argument is that if the function is called a large amount of times in an automated manner as for example
#'  in simulations, performance might be increased by not checking inputs in every single iteration. However, setting the argument
#'  to \code{FALSE} might be dangerous.
